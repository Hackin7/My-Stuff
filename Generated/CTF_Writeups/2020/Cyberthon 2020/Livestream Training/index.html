        <h1>Cyberthon 2020 Training</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.cyberthon.hci.edu.sg/">Cyberthon 2020 </a></p>
<p>&quot;Cyberthon is organised by Hwa Chong Institution (College Section), in collaboration with Defence Cyber Organisation (DCO) and Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies (CSIT) providing technical expertise. It is a cybersecurity competition that aims to enthuse and inspire students to develop crucial skills relating to Infocomm Technology. The competition is designed to be a skill-appropriate competition for students studying in the equivalent of Junior College/Centralised Institute Year 1 to Year 3.</p>
<p>Through this competition, students will gain a deeper understanding of real-life cyber security issues as well as opportunities to pit their cybersecurity skills against the best in their age group. In the long term, we hope that the competition can help to identify and nurture a core group of Infocomm talents with deep expertise in cyber defence.&quot;</p>
<h1>Event details</h1>
<p>This year it was held on 4th April 2020 online (Covid-19 lol) from 9pm to 5:30pm. Besides cyber security challenges like Reverse Engineering, Forensics, which are a good introduction into cyber security, there are also data science and machine learning challenges (Regression with pandas and scikit-learn), which is also good for beginners.</p>
<p>The CTF challenge was <a href="https://play.csdc20t.ctf.sg/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Not all challenges are covered, due to not being able to do and stuff
Most challenges were 100 points, except for Avocado Prices (500, Scoring based on accuracy), Sanity Check (1 point), Linear Fitting and CTFSG Datascience Grader (0 points)</p>
