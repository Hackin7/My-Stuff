<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is a sample blog post, written in full Markdown.
I guess this will also be the first post in my blog because why not why?</p>
<p>So firstly, if you are someone other than the author who ever saw this, I'm impressed because I thought no one read my notes.
That's partially why I decided to start making a blog. Instead of just leaving
my research in a Google Docs file and hidden deep within my Github repositories,
may as well put them on my website for someone to see right? Even if no one would
realistically want to spend time to read my articles.</p>
<p>Instead of doing the smart thing and using Jekyll, I coded my own Static Site
Generator in python. Totally extremely efficient.</p>
<p>So you may ask, what would I be posting?</p>
<ol>
<li>CTF Writeups. I do writeups about almost all my CTF challenges, including basic problems.
I feel that there is a great need for writeups on simple problems, since a lot of the writeups I see are obtuse Stuff</li>
<li>Experimentation Logs? I have recently been learning how to do stuff like</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Make a Computer from Scratch (using TTL Logic Chips)</li>
<li>Make an OS</li>
<li>3D Motion Graphics</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Summary notes? Because in real life no one has the time to read a full textbook or go on a full course.
Also I want to consolidate my knowledge</li>
</ol>
<p>I currently have too much free time to just waste, but I don't know what to do yet, so let's just see how things go with this. Maybe I'll make more Youtube videos, maybe this will not go anywhere and Ill just waste my life away. For now if you are interested, stick with me and see how it geos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have some past articles at <a href="https://makingbuildingstuff.blogspot.com/">makingbuildingstuff.blogspot.sg</a>, so check that out.</p>
