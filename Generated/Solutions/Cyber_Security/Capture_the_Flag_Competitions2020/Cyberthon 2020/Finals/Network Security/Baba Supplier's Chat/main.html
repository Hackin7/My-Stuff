<p>180, NETWORK SECURITY, 13 SOLVES</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>ShoppingBaba uses a chat server to interact with their suppliers.</p>
<p>Their suppliers connects to this chat server by using a client python script. Upon connecting, the server usually will provide the supplier with a random username with password for login purposes.</p>
<p>However, suppliers now complain that the connection ends too quickly and they can no longer login!</p>
<p>Investigate the client script and connect to p7ju6oidw6ayykt9zeglwyxired60yct.ctf.sg:21011 to get to the bottom of this!</p>
<h2>Given</h2>
<p>client.py</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Upon reading the client.py, the part that stands out the most to me is this</p>
<pre><code>try:    
    #Standard login
    data = sock.recv(1024)
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, 'received &quot;%s&quot;' % data
    print 'sending &quot;%s&quot; ' % &quot;shake_baba&quot;
    sock.sendall(&quot;shake_baba&quot;)
    data = sock.recv(1024)
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, 'received &quot;%s&quot;' % data

    # Reply hash of the message send to login
    print 'sending hashed &quot;%s&quot; ' % str(data)
    sock.sendall(str(hash(data)))

    data = sock.recv(1024)
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, 'received &quot;%s&quot;' % data

    # Get login credentials
    print 'sending hashed &quot;%s&quot; ' % str(data)
    sock.sendall(&quot;Hello!&quot;)

    data = sock.recv(1024)
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, 'received &quot;%s&quot;' % data
</code></pre>
<p>The code above basically retrieves data from and sends data to the server 3 times. That's why the connection is so short.
What I did was to retrieve and send data many times (using a while loop), as shown in the code below</p>
<pre><code>try:    
    #Standard login
    data = sock.recv(1024)
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, 'received &quot;%s&quot;' % data
    print 'sending &quot;%s&quot; ' % &quot;shake_baba&quot;
    sock.sendall(&quot;shake_baba&quot;)
    data = sock.recv(1024)
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, 'received &quot;%s&quot;' % data

    ### Basically change the code such that it runs many times ###########
    while True:
        # Reply hash of the message send to login
        print 'sending hashed &quot;%s&quot; ' % str(data)
        sock.sendall(str(hash(data)))

        data = sock.recv(1024)
        print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, 'received &quot;%s&quot;' % data
    ######################################################################
</code></pre>
<p>By the way, the code has to run on python2, which is annoying, but at least I have it installed I guess, so it's not so bad.</p>
<p>And here's the output:</p>
<pre><code>$ python2 ./solve.py p7ju6oidw6ayykt9zeglwyxired60yct.ctf.sg 21011
connecting to p7ju6oidw6ayykt9zeglwyxired60yct.ctf.sg port 21011
