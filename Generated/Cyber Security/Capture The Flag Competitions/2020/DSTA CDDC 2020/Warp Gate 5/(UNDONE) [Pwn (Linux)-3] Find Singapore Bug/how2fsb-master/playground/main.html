<h1>FSB Playground</h1>
<p>This serves as an example of how a FSB can be utilized and provides a working exploit template that can be used to build on to.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to modify and play around with various aspects of the script and use it to get a better understanding of how to exploit a FSB or to play with the application itself.</p>
<p>Try running the <a href="./tutorial_example.py">tutorial_example.py</a> and reading through what it's doing. </p>
<p>It does have a dependancy on: <a href="https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools">pwntools</a> please head over there and look up how to install this excellent python module.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that you use something to make the use of GDB a bit 'friendlier'.
I would recommend using one of the following:
 - <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a>
 - <a href="https://github.com/longld/peda">PEDA</a></p>
<p>If you run the script with the <code>-d</code> option it will cause gdb to attach to the running process with the breakpoint set at exactly the right place before the vulnerable <code>printf()</code> call is made.</p>
<p>You can then look at the various parameters passed to the <code>printf()</code> statement and poke around the memory and stack etc...</p>
