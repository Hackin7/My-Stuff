<h1>My New Language</h1>
<p>120, DATA SCIENCE, 49 SOLVES</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The attackers created their own language for their secret communication. We were able to intercept a file but it doesn't seem to make any sense! Further tracing to the attackers' C2 allowed us to find a program that would give some hints as to what the file might mean...</p>
<p>Can you figure out the hidden message?</p>

<p>Note: The flag will appear in the form Cyberthon{...}.</p>
<h2>Given</h2>
<p>file.txt</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>This is a question I couldn't do in the competition (my friends solved it first). 
I'm not very sure how to solve it, but here's what I gather from my understanding.</p>
<p>On Inspecting <code>file.txt</code>, you get this
<code>weigen inhanus catets acteous aticittier</code></p>
<p>By testing all the words in the file with the website, you get <code>fruit that is a color</code>.
By searching orange, you can get the flag. You can also end up with this when you query for a colour.
