<h1>Rendezvous</h1>
<p>300, Forensics, 52 Solves as of Solving</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The police managed to intercept a communication between two parties that have been known to participate in illegal activities. Based on the intelligence we've received from our informants on the ground, they are planning a face to face meeting for an illegal transaction. Are you able to help us identify where that meeting might take place?</p>
<p>The flag for this challenge is the name of the location in lowercase characters. The following is the format for this flag: CTFSG{xxx_xxxxx_xxxx_xxxx}</p>
<p>p.s. each 'x' corresponds to one character.</p>
<h2>Given</h2>
<p>interception.pcapng</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Analysing the pcapng in wireshark, you notice some SMTP data. Following the TCP stream you get the message and the attachment <code>rendezvous</code> encoded in base 64.</p>

<p>Using a python program with the <a href="https://stackabuse.com/encoding-and-decoding-base64-strings-in-python/">base64 library</a> to decode the data, you get an image

<p>Looks ordinary. Let's check binwalk.

$ binwalk attachment </p>

```</p>
<p>There's some TIFF image data apparently, let's check out the image properties.

<p>Apparently there's some coordinates to check out. Putting the coordinates <code>1°19'50.73"N 103°50'49.84"E</code> in Google Maps, you get somewhere in Toa Payoh.</p>
