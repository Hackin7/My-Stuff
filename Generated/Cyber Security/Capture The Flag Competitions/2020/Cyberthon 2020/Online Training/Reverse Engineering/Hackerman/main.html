<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Time to learn how to read assembly! Your task is to figure out the correct input for the given assembly code.</p>
<p>Note: The flag format is <code>CTFSG{&lt;input&gt;}</code></p>
<p>X86 Assembly Tutorial</p>
<h2>Given</h2>
<p>disassembly.txt</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Work your way and reverse engineer the code step by step. My disassembly efforts in in <code>disassembly annotated.asm</code>, and after that, I made a simple python program in <code>solve.py</code> which explains what the algorithm does in a nutshell, and produces the input string</p>
<p>Some things to take note of
1. Make sure your actual disassembly code is not modified. I wasted 2 hours of my life trying to notice an error (that I replaced a 0 with a 6)
2. Little Endian formatting</p>
