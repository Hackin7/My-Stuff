<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Not again? Seems like this flag has been encrypted by a Java program. Let's write a script to decrypt it!</p>
<p>Hint 1: Not all decompilers are equal
Hint 2: Is it really as complex as it seems?</p>
<h2>Given</h2>
<p>flag.txt.out</p>
<p>SuperSecureSipher.class</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Use CFR Decompiler because it gives superior code.
After that just write code to reverse the steps. </p>
<p>One trick to take note of is that the first 2 loops are just generating a random number. And the first character of the output string gives you that random number in ascii form. You can then use that for reversing</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that XOR <code>^</code> is reversible. So just reverse character by character.</p>
<p>My solution is in <code>Main.java</code>. When I run my code, the thing seems to be missing a <code>}</code> so I just added it.</p>
