# About Me
I have always liked tinkering when computers and electronics when I was in Primary School, such as playing around with Linux on my Computer. In Primary 5, I started getting into electronics and programming, learning Python, and making some Raspberry Pi and Arduino Projects. 

As the years passed, I kept challenging myself by learning new skills, such as Electronics (Arduino and Raspberry Pi), Web/ Android App Development, Cyber Security, Unity Game Development and more. I have developed many hobby projects and had much fun doing it. 

Having visited and volunteered for Maker Faire Singapore and other community events, I am fascinated by what people can do if they work together, and appreciate Maker Culture. Having built projects for the community (for events such as TechPals), I'm surprised by how my skills can be used to change the world.

When I was in Chung Cheng High Yishun. I took up O Level Computing. In Nanyang Junior College, I took up A Level H2 Computing along with H3 NTU Semiconductor Devices and Physics. I have also participated in many events representing Nanyang Junior College and even Singapore.

However, that is not to say that Computing and Electronics are the only things in my life. I have also liked music, having obtained a Yamaha Electone Grade 6 Certification and am currently preparing for Electone Grade 5 Examination. I also like playing sports like Volleyball, Basketball, and more. One of my favourite moments in life is when I finally won 3rd place in the Chung Cheng Marina Bay Run (My Secondary School's Marathon Event) in 2018, after much training.

To me, both the hardware and the software of modern devices and systems are interesting, as one cannot exist without the other. When combined, they can create spectacular experiences for users. As such, I aim to pursue Electrical Engineering at NUS.
